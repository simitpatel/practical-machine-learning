<h1>Visual Stock Screener</h1>

    <a href="https://simitpatel.shinyapps.io/screener-shiny">The Visual Stock Screener</a> is meant to help investors quickly find and evaluate dividend stocks that can help investors build a passive income stream over time. Here’s how the screener works:
<ul>
<li>1.	It filters against a list stocks that are listed in the US (including ETFs and ADRs).  </li>
<li>2.	The screener allows the user to specify a range of values that are acceptable for a number of key metrics:</li>
<ul>
<li>a.	Investors can specify a range of acceptable market capitalization. Market capitalization, or the amount that would be required to buy up all the outstanding shares of stock, are often seen as reflective of the stability of a stock. The larger the market capitalization, the more stable and less volatile a stock is likely to be. In the screener, the size of the plot is proportional to its market capitalization. </li>
<li>b.	Investors can also specify an acceptable price/sales ratio range. Higher price/sales ratio stocks are seen as more expensive relative to the underlying merits of their business. Stocks with a higher price/sales ratio are a light blue, while those with a lower price/sales are dark blue. </li>
<li>c.	The shape of the plot reflects its payout ratio. Payout ratio is a reflection of what portion of the business’s income is returned in the form of dividends to investors. If the payout ratio is very high, it may reflect a company that issuing unsustainably high dividends, or one that has little room to grow dividends. Stocks with a payout ratio greater than one are shaped differently than those with a ratio below 1. 
<li>d.	Lastly and most importantly is dividend yield – the measurement of the annual dividends paid per share relative to the current stock price. The yield constitutes the y-axis, and thus stocks that are higher on the y-axis offer a higher dividend yield. </li></ul>
<li>3.	The plot only portrays the top 10 tickers that meet the criteria specified by the user. If the user clicks the “Data” tab above the plot, they can see the full list of stocks in the data set that meet the criteria specified.   </li></ul>
